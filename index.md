# Hello Everyone!

I am Vinayak Nayak, a Mechanical Engineer by vocation,currently working as an AI Developer at [Okkular](https://www.okkular.io/).

Ever since I encountered that sophisticated real world concepts could be modelled as simulations in isolation during my undergrad, I was and am thrilled about the power of data. Since then, I have come a long way and yet it feels just like the beginning of my data journey.

I have worked on problems involving structured data, tabular data, relational data to extract insights, make predictions and/or prescriptions, identify and interpret patterns in these data etc. 

A major portion of my work involves working with unstructured data, that too particularly images. I have worked on image classification, image regression, content based image retrieval and image to text (image captioning) use-cases. I am also well-versed with Natural Language Processing tasks like Language Modelling, Text Classification, Text Generation and Text Processing. As an AI Developer, almost 90% of the time I deal with Images and Text and only in 10% of the cases, I deal with traditional tabular data problems; however, as an overarching theme, almost all problems are either classification or regression, the concepts that I've learned in either cases are inter-convertible and I apply them across different use-cases all the time. 

I built this personal website as a space where I can share my views, ideas, projects that I dabbled with. My main focus is to create content that an older version of myself could see and be like - yeah, I wish someone had told me this back then! In doing so I hope these posts that I author could serve as an inspiration to beginners to try things out, experiment and not be afraid of asking for help because that's the way I got to learn a lot of things in this field. 

In my free time, I really love watching anime especially from the `shounen`, `sports` and  `slice of life` genres. By far, [Kuroko no basket](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11771/Kuroko_no_Basket) and [Haikyuu](https://myanimelist.net/anime/20583/Haikyuu) are really at the top amongst my list of most favorite anime! Apart from watching anime, I also enjoy reading light novels and short stories which irrespective of being fiction or otherwise incite thoughts in me and give a new perspective to view life.

I hope you'll enjoy reading my posts and if you do, I would love to hear your reactions and take constructive criticism to improve my content and evolve. We're all always learning aren't we :blush: !

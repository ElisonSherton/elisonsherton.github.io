# Hello Everyone!

I am Vinayak Nayak, a Mechanical Engineer by vocation,currently working as a Data Scientist at [Karza Technologies Pvt. Ltd.](https://karza.in/). 

Ever since I found out that sophisticated real world phenomena could be modelled as simulations using the power of computing, which was during my undergrad, I was thrilled with the power of data. Using C++ we had modelled a physical process of metal vapor deposition in a low pressure container by heating heavy metals; this process was stochastic in nature and we modelled it using a Monte Carlo simulation; this was a `Eureka` moment for me.  Since then, I have come a long way and considering the pace at which this field is growing, it still feels like there's a lot more to come in the world of data and computing as it's constantly evolving.

I have worked on problems involving structured/tabular data, relational data (both SQL and NoSQL) to extract insights, make predictions and/or prescriptions, identify and interpret patterns in these data etc. 

That being said, most of my work involves working with unstructured data, that too particularly images. I have worked on several usecases like image classification, image regression, content based image retrieval and image to text, image captioning in particular. I also have functional knowledge of Natural Language Processing tasks like Language Modelling, Text Classification, Text Generation and Text Processing. 

In my Data Science journey, almost 90% of the problem statements that I've dealt with are centered around Images and Text and only in about 10% of the cases, I have dealt with Structured/Tabular data problems. I would say that all the use-cases that I have majorly worked on in my Deep Learning journey could fall under either of these three broad categories: classification, regression, retrieval. 

I built this personal website as a space where I can share my views, ideas, projects that I dabbled with. My main focus is to create content that an older version of myself could see and be like - yeah, I wish someone had told me this back when I was starting out! [This post](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2017-04-06-alternatives.html) really served as a big inspiration behind setting up this blogging website. I really hope these posts could serve as an inspiration to beginners or anyone to try things out, experiment and not be afraid of asking for help because that's the way I got to learn a lot of things in this field. 

In my free time, I really love watching anime especially from the `shounen`, `sports` and  `slice of life` genres. Apart from watching anime, I also enjoy reading light novels and short stories and non-fiction books.

I hope you'll enjoy reading my posts and if you do, I would love to hear your reactions and take constructive criticism to improve my content and evolve. We're all always learning aren't we :

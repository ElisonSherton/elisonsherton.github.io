# Hello Everyone!

I am Vinayak Nayak, a Mechanical Engineer by profession, currently employed as a Data Scientist at [Perfios Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.perfios.com/)


Ever since I discovered that sophisticated real-world phenomena could be modeled as simulations using the power of computing, which was during my undergraduate studies, I have been fascinated by the potential of data. During that time, using C++, we modeled a physical process involving metal vapor deposition in a low-pressure container by heating heavy metals. This process was inherently stochastic, and we simulated it using a Monte Carlo simulation. It was a 'Eureka' moment for me. Since then, I have come a long way, and considering the rapid pace at which this field is growing, it still feels like there is much more to explore in the realm of data and computing, given its constant evolution.

I have tackled problems involving structured/tabular data and relational data (both SQL and NoSQL) to extract insights, make predictions, prescribe solutions, and identify/interpret patterns in the data. However, the majority of my work involves dealing with unstructured data, particularly images. I have undertaken various use cases such as image classification, image regression, content-based image retrieval, image-to-text conversion, and image captioning. Additionally, I possess functional knowledge of Natural Language Processing tasks, including Language Modeling, Text Classification, Text Generation, and Text Processing.

Throughout my Data Science journey, nearly 90% of the problem statements I have encountered revolved around Images and Text, with only about 10% related to Structured/Tabular data problems. I would categorize the majority of the use-cases I have worked on in my Deep Learning journey under three broad categories: classification, regression, and retrieval.

I established this personal website as a platform to share my views, ideas, and projects I have worked on. My primary focus is to create content that my past self would have found valuableâ€”something along the lines of "I wish someone had told me this when I was starting out!" [This post]((https://www.fast.ai/posts/2017-04-06-alternatives.html)) served a significant inspiration for setting up this blogging website. I genuinely hope these posts inspire beginners or anyone in the field to try things out, experiment, and not be afraid to seek help, as that's how I learned a lot in this field.

In my free time, I particularly enjoy watching anime, especially from the 'shounen,' 'sports,' and 'slice of life' genres. Besides anime, I indulge in reading light novels, short stories, and non-fiction books. Currently I am watching Monster and Jujutsu Kaisen and just lovin it!!!

I hope you enjoy reading my posts, and if you do, I would love to hear your reactions and receive constructive criticism to enhance my content and continue evolving. After all, we are all constantly learning, aren't we?
